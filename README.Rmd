# Overview

**BCDAG** (**B**ayesian **C**ausal **DAG**) is a package for Bayesian DAG structure learning and causal effect estimation from observational Gaussian data.

The methodology implemented has been presented in [Castelletti, F. \& Mascaro, A. (2021). *Structural learning and estimation of joint causal effects among network-dependent variables*, Statistical Methods \& Applications, 1-26](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10260-021-00579-1)

# Installation

The package can be installed executing the following chunk of code:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alesmascaro/BCDAG")
```

# How to use

The workflow of the package consists of two sequential steps: causal structure learning, performed through the function `learn_DAG()` and causal effect estimation, performed through the function `get_causaleffect()`. For a more detailed description of the inner mechanisms of these two functions, we refer the reader to the vignettes.

## Example

Before using the two main functions of the package, we generate some data:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(BCDAG)
# Randomly generate a DAG and the DAG-parameters
q = 8
w = 0.2
set.seed(123)
DAG = rDAG(q = q, w = w)
outDL = rDAGWishart(n = 1, DAG = DAG, a = q, U = diag(1, q))
L = outDL$L; D = outDL$D
Sigma = solve(t(L))%*%D%*%solve(L)
n = 200
# Generate observations from a Gaussian DAG-model
X = mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n = n, sigma = Sigma)
```

We can use the function `learn_DAG()` to perform causal structure learning from the generated observational dataset:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Run the MCMC
out = learn_DAG(S = 5000, burn = 1000, a = q, U = diag(1,q)/n, data = X, w = w)
```
Next, we can compute the BMA estimate of the causal effect on a response variable consequent to a hard intervention on a set of nodes by using `get_causaleffect()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# the causal effect on node 1 of an intervention on {3,4}
out |>
  get_causaleffect(targets = c(3,4), response = 1, BMA = TRUE)
```

The three steps here implemented are detailed in the vignettes [1 - Random data generation from Gaussian DAG-models](https://alesmascaro.github.io/BCDAG/vignettes/bcdag_generatedata.html), [2 - MCMC scheme for posterior inference of Gaussian DAG models: the `learn_DAG()` function](https://alesmascaro.github.io/BCDAG/vignettes/bcdag_learnDAG.html) and [3 - Elaborate on the output of `learn_DAG()` using get_ functions](https://alesmascaro.github.io/BCDAG/vignettes/bcdag_getfamily.html)
