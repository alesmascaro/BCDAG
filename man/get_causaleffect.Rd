\title{Estimate total causal effects from the MCMC output}
\usage{
get_causaleffect(learnDAG_output, targets, response, BMA = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{learnDAG_output}{object of class \code{bcdag}}

\item{targets}{numerical \eqn{(p,1)} vector with labels of target nodes}

\item{response}{numerical label of response variable}

\item{BMA}{boolean; if TRUE, the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) estimate of the total causal effect is returned;
if FALSE, samples from the posterior distribution of causal effect coefficients are returned}
}
\value{
Either a \eqn{(p,1)} vector containing BMA causal effect estimates, or a \eqn{(S,p)} matrix collecting \eqn{S} draws from the posterior
of the \eqn{p} causal effect coefficients.
}
\description{
This function provides causal effect estimates from the output of \code{learn_DAG}
}
\details{
Output of \code{learn_dag} function consists of \eqn{S} draws from the joint posterior of DAGs and DAG-parameters in a zero-mean Gaussian DAG-model;
see the documentation of \code{learn_DAG} for more details.

The total causal effect on a given variable of interest (\code{response}) consequent to a joint intervention on a set of variables (\code{targets})
is defined according to Pearl's do-calculus theory and under the Gaussian assumption can be expressed as a function of parameters \code{(D,L)},
representing a (Cholesky) reparameterization of the covariance matrix.

Specifically, to each intervened variable a causal effect coefficient is associated and the posterior distribution of the latter can be recovered from posterior draws
of the DAG parameters returned by \code{learn_DAG}. For each coefficient a sample of size \eqn{S} from its posterior is available. If required, the only
Bayesian Model Average (BMA) estimate (obtained as the sample mean of the \eqn{S} draws) can be returned by setting \code{BMA = TRUE}.

Notice that, whenever implemented with \code{collapse = FALSE}, \code{learn_DAG} returns the marginal posterior distribution of DAGs only.
In this case, \code{get_causaleffect} preliminarily performs posterior inference of DAG parameters by drawing samples from the posterior of \code{(D,L)}.
