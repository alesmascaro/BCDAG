In this vignette, the basic elements of the first version of the package `bcdag` are shown. In the first section, the functions `rDAG()` and `rDAGWishart()` are presented as simple tools for sampling DAGs and DAGs' parameters for Gaussian data. In the second section, the suggested workflow involving the function `learn_DAG()` and the functions of the `get_` family are shown. In the third section, a simple application to a real dataset is proposed. 

## Generating data through `rDAG()` and `rDAGWishart()`

As a first step for this vignette, we want to generate some data to use the methods implemented in the package `BCDAG`.  

```{r setup}

```
