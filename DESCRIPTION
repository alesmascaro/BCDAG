Description: A collection of functions for structure learning of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and estimation of joint causal effects from observational Gaussian data. Main algorithm consists of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for posterior inference of DAG structures, DAG parameters and causal effects between variables.
